            Hello, I'm Rock Frederic, originally from Haiti and now pursuing my
            passion for technology in the United States. My journey into the tech
            world began back in Haiti, where, despite limited access to the latest
            gadgets and the internet, I was always the kid who could figure out how
            things worked. My curiosity often made me the go-to person for anything
            tech-related in my community
        </p>
        <p>
            After moving to the US at the age of 17, I dreamed of becoming a
            professional soccer player. However, life had different plans. Injuries
            sustained during the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and
            subsequent surgeries, ended my sports aspirations and led me through
            years of recovery and self-discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this challenging time, I found solace and inspiration in my
            girlfriend's dedication to her studies, which motivated me to return to
            school. I enrolled at Georgia Southern University, where I was
            captivated by the world of Information Technology and Cybersecurity. It
            was here that I truly realized the potential to turn my early curiosity
            into a thriving career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I am not just an IT student; I am an aspiring cybersecurity
            specialist dedicated to understanding and improving the digital
            landscapes that drive our world. My journey from a curious kid in Haiti
            to a tech enthusiast in the US has been nothing short of remarkable, and
            I am excited to see where this path will lead me next."
